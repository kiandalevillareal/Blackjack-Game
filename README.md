# Blackjack-Game
The popular casino game, BLACKJACK, can now be played during breaktime without leaving your office and without spending any amount of real money. 

This game was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Works like the real game (users have the POV of a player only) as it:
- Generates 2 random cards 
- Asks users if they will hit (ask for another card) or
- Allows users to stand (stay with the cards on their hand)
- Allows users to place their bet
- Does not allow users to play with 0 balance
